## Introduction

mYOUsician is a networking platform designed to connect musicians worldwide. The platform consists of two main components:

- **Public Database**: A searchable database of musician profiles accessible without registration
- **Profile Management**: Account features for musicians to create and manage their public profiles

This documentation explains how to use both aspects of the platform effectively.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Platform

Visit [myousician.com](https://myousician.com) to access the platform. No registration is required to search the public database.

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection
- JavaScript enabled
- Mobile or desktop device

## Public Database

### Searching for Musicians

The public database allows you to search for musicians based on various criteria:

1. **Genre**: Filter by musical genre (classical, jazz, rock, etc.)
2. **Instrument**: Search for specific instruments
3. **Location**: Find musicians in specific geographical areas
4. **Name**: Search for musicians by name
5. **Category**: Filter by artist, teacher, or student status

### Understanding Search Results

Search results display:

- Basic profile information (name, location)
- Musical skills (genres and instruments)
- Education background
- Occupation details
- Contact information (if provided by the musician)
- Links to social media profiles and videos (if provided)

### Contacting Musicians

You can contact musicians directly through:

- Email addresses displayed in profiles
- Phone numbers (if provided)
- Social media links
- Video platform profiles

Note that all contact information is publicly visible if the musician has chosen to include it.

## Profile Creation and Management

### Creating Your Musician Profile

1. Log in to your account

### Managing Public Information

You control what information appears in your public profile:

1. Use the visibility toggles next to each section
2. Preview your public profile to see how it appears to others
3. Update your information at any time

### Important Privacy Considerations

- **Contact Information**: Email addresses and phone numbers added to your profile will be publicly visible
- **Location**: Consider using general locations (city level) rather than specific addresses
- **External Links**: Only add social media and video links you're comfortable sharing publicly

## Privacy and Security

### Understanding Data Visibility

The platform distinguishes between:

- **Public Data**: Information displayed in your public profile, visible to anyone
- **Account Data**: Login credentials and account settings, visible only to you

### Protecting Your Information

1. **Share Selectively**: Only add information to your profile that you're comfortable being public
2. **Contact Methods**: Consider using a secondary email for public display
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your public profile to ensure it reflects your current sharing preferences

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter harassment or abuse:

1. Use the "Report" button on the user's profile
2. Include detailed information about the issue
3. Our team will review the report and take appropriate action

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Profile Not Appearing in Search

- Ensure your profile is complete with at least one genre and instrument
- Check that your account is verified
- Allow up to 24 hours for new profiles to appear in search results

#### Unable to Edit Profile

- Make sure you're logged in
- Clear your browser cache
- Try using a different browser if issues persist

#### Missing or Incorrect Information

The database is publicly accessible. While you control what information is included in your profile, you cannot restrict who can view your public profile information.
